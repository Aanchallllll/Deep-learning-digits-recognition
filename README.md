## Introduction
This project aims at building neural networks from scratch that involves using basic libraries like NumPy only, without relying on external libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Keras.



## Description
This project focuses on developing an effective identification system for sorting a variety of digit inputs.
The approach integrates key techniques such as Neural Networks (NNs) and leverages Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib 



## Tech Stack 
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)


## Challenges Faced

Some of the challenges faced during the building of the model are as follows, 
1. Computational Cost: Constructing models without using high-level frameworks often results in longer training times and increased coding complexity. 




\
This challenge was mitigated by optimizing code through vectorized operations with libraries like NumPy for faster matrix computations. 

2. Accuracy Enhancement: Achieving high accuracy without established frameworks requires strategic design. 
\
Implementing effective activation functions, such as ReLU, boosted convergence rates and introduced non-linear behavior.

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of 85% on training data. 

- A test data sample which is predicted by the model can be seen in the below image,
